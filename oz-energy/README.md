# ozwillo-ozenergy

Ozenergy web application.

## Installating and Running

Please refer to the README.md file in the parent folder.

## How to build-run-debug the code

As before, please refer to the README.md file in the parent folder to install the necessary tooling, and **don't forget to create the application.yml file with the right config if you chose to change the datacore port for example**.

Instead of lauching the application with :

```
mvn spring-boot:run -DrunAggregation
```

Simply launch it in Debug Mode from your Java IDE of choice (we recommend Eclipse, since it was the one used to write the application), and you're set !
